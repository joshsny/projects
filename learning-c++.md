# Learning C++

I have decided, during this period of lockdown due to COVID-19, to learn some C++. Being a maths graduate, I usually tampered with high-end languages and didn't go any lower than something like PHP. This is a shame, since learning middle or lower level languages can improve understanding of lower level concepts that are important, such as memory allocation. C++ is a middle level language and a good place for me to start.

### Basic Notions

There are some important things to clear up before I start writing my first C++ program. Here are the distinctions between Objects, Classes, Methods and Instance Variables.

* **Object** − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors - wagging, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.
* **Class** − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.
* **Methods** − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.
* **Instance Variables** − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.

### Hello World

As always, my first C++ program is just Hello World.
